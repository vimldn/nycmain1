    {
      q: `How does matching work for ${nounLower} in ${locationName}?`,

The request is routed to available local ${nounLower} professionals who serve ${locationName}, so you can get next steps without calling multiple places. You can then review the details and book service based on availability and fit.`,
    },
    {
      q: `How fast can I get help in ${locationName}?`,
      a: `Response time depends on demand, time of day, and which providers are currently available nearby. Including the exact problem, building type, and any access details helps route the request to the right option faster. For urgent requests, it is best to submit as soon as possible and stay reachable for follow-up questions.`,
    },
    {
      q: `What affects pricing for ${nounLower} in ${locationName}?`,
      a: `Pricing is usually driven by the type of job, urgency, complexity, and how much time or equipment is required. Building access also matters in NYC, since stairs, elevators, parking, and loading rules can change labor time and costs. The most accurate pricing comes from clear details up front, especially for emergencies or specialty work.`,
    },
    {
      q: `What details should I include for the best match?`,
      a: `Include the neighborhood, the type of service you need, and whether it is urgent or scheduled. Add any specifics you know, such as lock type, number of rooms, the size of the job, photos, or what has already been tried. Better details reduce back-and-forth and improve the chance you are matched to the right provider on the first pass.`,
    },
    {
      q: `Is this only for emergencies?`,
      a: `No, you can request urgent help or schedule a non-urgent appointment depending on the service category. Many people use this for planned work such as move-in services, upgrades, or routine maintenance. If you have a preferred time window, include it so scheduling can be aligned early.`,
    },
    {
      q: `Are the professionals licensed, insured, or verified?`,
      a: `Providers matched through requests operate in NYC and handle the relevant service category, but licensing and insurance can vary depending on the trade. If the job requires specific licensing or proof of insurance, request it before booking and confirm it applies to your building's requirements. This is especially important for work involving building access, certificates of insurance, or regulated repairs.`,
    },
    {
      q: `Can I compare options or quotes before booking?`,
      a: `In many cases, yes, especially for scheduled work where the scope can be described clearly in advance. For urgent situations, the priority is often the fastest available option, but you should still ask about pricing structure and what is included. The more complete your request details are, the easier it is to compare apples to apples.`,
    },
    {
      q: `What should I do right now while I wait for a response?`,
      a: `If it is an emergency involving safety, gas, electrical hazards, or a medical risk, contact emergency services first. If the issue is urgent but not life-threatening, gather details that help diagnose the problem, like photos, the exact symptoms, and what triggered it. Staying reachable and ready to confirm access details can significantly speed up next steps.`,
    },
    {
      q: `Do you serve only ${locationName}, or nearby areas too?`,
      a: `${locationName} is the focus for this page, but many providers also serve nearby neighborhoods depending on availability. If you are on the border of another area, include cross streets or nearby landmarks to prevent confusion. Accurate location details help avoid wasted time and mismatches.`,
